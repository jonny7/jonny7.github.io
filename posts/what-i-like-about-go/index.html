I remember looking at this and thinking, you look like <code>C</code>. But fast forward a bit and do I ❤️ Go. Certainly it&rsquo;s a little to get used to, depending on what languages your used to</p><h5 id=its-simple>It&rsquo;s simple</h5><p>This is often peoples biggest love and gripe about it. It&rsquo;s so simple, so simple things like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>reduce</code> don&rsquo;t exist. So if you&rsquo;re coming from languages that have them. Say goodbye to those. It only has ~25 keywords and ultimately Go it a simple language, but probably more verbose than you&rsquo;re maybe used to. But once you get used to that, there are some surprising benefits.</p><h5 id=standardized-formatting>Standardized formatting</h5><blockquote><p>Gofmt&rsquo;s style is no one&rsquo;s favorite, yet gofmt is everyone&rsquo;s favorite.</p></blockquote><p>Rob Pike said this years ago. But because it has one formatter, everyone&rsquo;s structure looks the same, which brings some really nice familiarity with external libraries.</p><h5 id=all-code-generally-looks-the-same>All code generally looks the same</h5><p>Following on from the above points. Because it has so few keywords, there are less ways to do things. That coupled with the formatter means you don&rsquo;t get the kinds of scenarios where you have a <code>Scala</code> dev come to a <code>Java</code> project and now portions of your code looks like <code>Scala</code>, some <code>Java</code> and some maybe some other language. This is probably my favorite side effect of Go.</p><h5 id=its-easy-to-get-going>It&rsquo;s easy to get going</h5><p>You can feasibly learn Go in a long weekend. That&rsquo;s not to say you&rsquo;re a master at it, but you&rsquo;d be in a decent place. There&rsquo;s not many main stream languages you can do that with.</p><h5 id=concurrency>Concurrency</h5><p>Go is famed for its concurrency. Go&rsquo;s concurrency is great, but concurrency is not that easy to master. But Go makes it a lot easier and handles a lot of the minutia for you.</p><h5 id=go-routines>Go routines</h5><p>Go routines are so small, it&rsquo;s generally ok to create 1000s at a time and you probably won&rsquo;t even notice.</p><h5 id=cyclic-imports-are-not-allowed>Cyclic imports are not allowed</h5><p>This helps keep Go programs dependency graph small.</p><h5 id=no-unused-variables>No unused variables</h5><p>Most languages don&rsquo;t care about unused vars, or they at most throw a warning. Go simply won&rsquo;t compile.</p><h5 id=truly-cross-platform>Truly cross platform</h5><p>Go runs on all platforms with very minimal work</p><h5 id=go-is-fast-and-lightweight>Go is FAST and lightweight</h5><p>Go is very fast and produces very small static binaries. This is great for things like <code>Docker</code>. I use a scratch container and just copy the binary in. Resulting in an image of ~5MB. Give or take the size of your project.</p><h5 id=the-standard-library-is-excellent>The Standard Library is excellent</h5><p>It really is amazing. You can feasibly write a massive, highly performant system without using anything but the standard library.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
